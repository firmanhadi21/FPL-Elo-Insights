    "This notebook implements a comprehensive FPL prediction system that:\n",
    "- ✅ Uses official Fantasy Premier League scoring rules\n",
    "- ✅ Incorporates 2025/26 defensive contribution points (CBIT)\n",
    "- ✅ Provides position-specific goal values (6/5/4 points)\n",
    "- ✅ Returns integer-only predictions (as per FPL rules)\n",
    "- ✅ Includes team strength analysis and fixture difficulty\n",
    "- ✅ Offers personalized team strategy and captain recommendations\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Dynamic Data Discovery** \n",
    "- **Before**: Hard-coded to use only GW0 and GW1\n",
    "- **After**: Automatically discovers and uses ALL available gameweeks\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Scales automatically as more data becomes available\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Enhanced Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- **Before**: 33 basic features\n",
    "- **After**: 49 features including 21 form-based features\n",
    "- **New Features Added**:\n",
    "  - **Rolling Averages**: 3-game and 5-game windows\n",
    "  - **Form Trends**: Recent vs historical performance  \n",
    "  - **Consistency Metrics**: Performance variance analysis\n",
    "  - **Playing Time Trends**: Starter status and minutes trends\n",
    "  - **Expanding Averages**: Career-long performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Multi-Window Analysis**\n",
    "- **3-Game Rolling**: Recent form analysis\n",
    "- **5-Game Rolling**: Medium-term form\n",
    "- **Expanding Windows**: Season-long trends\n",
    "- **Trend Analysis**: Performance direction (improving/declining)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Robust Data Handling**\n",
    "- **Automatic Position Mapping**: Handles different data formats\n",
    "- **Missing Data Management**: Graceful handling of incomplete data\n",
    "- **Flexible Column Detection**: Works with varying data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Scalable Architecture**\n",
    "- **Future-Ready**: Works for any gameweek (GW6, GW10, etc.)\n",
    "- **Automatic Target Detection**: Finds next gameweek to predict\n",
    "- **Data Validation**: Ensures quality before processing\n",

    "**Training Data**: GW0-GW1 (2 gameweeks, 1,375 player records)  \n",
    "**Features**: 49 enhanced features (21 form-based)  \n",

    "\n",
    "When you have more data (e.g., predicting GW6):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add new gameweek folders** with required files:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   /GW3/playerstats.csv, players.csv, teams.csv\n",
    "   /GW4/playerstats.csv, players.csv, teams.csv  \n",
    "   /GW5/playerstats.csv, players.csv, teams.csv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the notebook** - it will automatically:\n",
    "   - Detect GW0-GW5 as training data (5 gameweeks!)\n",
    "   - Use rolling 3-game and 5-game averages\n",
    "   - Create robust form metrics\n",
    "   - Predict GW6 with much higher accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Benefits with more data**:\n",
    "   - **5x more training data** vs current 2 gameweeks\n",
    "   - **Meaningful rolling averages** (3-5 games)\n",
    "   - **True form analysis** (injury recovery, team changes)\n",
    "   - **Seasonal patterns** (fixture difficulty impact)\n",
